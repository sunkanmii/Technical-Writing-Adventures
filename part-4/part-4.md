Hi all! It's been a minute. :) Let's quickly run down what you've missed me doing in the past few weeks.

> P.S I have written a couple of articles that may never see the light of day, but who knows? I may still publish it here later on. Anyway, back to API documentation.

# OpenAPI Specification and [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)

I‚Äôve finished chapters 4 & 5 of Tom Johnson‚Äôs [Documenting APIs](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) and one thing I‚Äôve discovered during my study is that Stoplight is an easier and faster alternative if you‚Äôre looking to produce API documentation fast and you‚Äôre short of time. I really do think that while YAML or JSON has its benefits, Stoplight may be the better alternative if you‚Äôre looking to save time for the most part and OpenAPI may not be as comprehensive as Stoplight.

In addition, Stoplight allows you to visualize your API lifecycle management and import your JSON code, helping you define the JSON schema for the code.

It‚Äôs just a much better tool than writing the raw JSON code or YAML. So like selecting a framework to make your work faster and easier, you can choose this tool to make API documentation better.

Testing out APIs in the coming weeks should be a lot of fun. Scoured through Github and found some interesting repos that I can contribute to. Here‚Äôs a couple of screenshots of the responses I got when I asked if I could contribute to the API documentation.

It‚Äôs a mix of Python and JavaScript. So it should be fun. I‚Äôm super happy to get started on these and *properly* document everything I learn or refine properly. So follow for more info!

## Hashnode‚Äôs Documentation Tool

I want to try out, experiment with and review¬†[Docs by Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/products/docs). It‚Äôs a new documentation tool I came across the other day and I must say, Hashnode‚Äôs team is putting in the work! Some notable brands like freecodecamp are using this tool and a bunch more other ones:

![Docs by Hashnode's trusted companies](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730586387085/1e419a44-ce3b-42da-9b26-0b6c71114ba6.png align="center")

It‚Äôs relatively new, but I‚Äôm excited to try out its headless mode, GraphQL support, and how easy it may be to set up API references. I might just write a separate article on this, analyzing its strengths and what I feel they may need to work on.

# More Technical Writing Resources

[Damilola Ezekiel](https://github.com/dharmelolar) wrote a [great piece](https://github.com/dharmelolar/technical-writing-resources/blob/main/README.md) on numerous technical writing tools, books, courses, communities, Open-Source projects you can contribute to, and a whole bunch more. It‚Äôs good.

[Damilola Ezekiel](https://github.com/dharmelolar)‚Äôs [Technical Writing Resources](https://github.com/dharmelolar/technical-writing-resources/blob/main/README.md) is a good guide if you‚Äôre starting out in technical writing or you‚Äôre interested in learning more about it as it contains useful resources for technical writing. It provides valuable resources that currently has over 170 Github stars and counting.

This made me smile. Not because I found one of the best resources for technical writing, but I also discovered it‚Äôs from a fellow Nigerian. üò≠ I love it! I love seeing my people shine in the tech space and I will toot their horn for the world to see.
